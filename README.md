#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods, tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It is important  because it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering started from the development of programming languages like Fortran, C etc, establishing of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirements: Gathering of user needs and system requirements and documenting it.
b. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
c. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d. Testing: Conducting various tests to make sure the software meets quality standards and functional requirement.
e. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f. Maintenance: Providing ongoing updates, support and enhancement to the software after deploying it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a. Waterfall: It is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like waterfall
   Examples of real-life scenarios of waterfall model:
   i. Scenario: A company is developing a new electronic device, such as a smartphone. The process includes requirements gathering, design, prototyping, manufacturing, and testing.
   Application: The Waterfall model is suitable because the product requirements and design specifications are clear and unlikely to change. The project can progress through each stage sequentially, with extensive testing and quality checks at the end.

   ii. Scenario: A bank is implementing a new core banking system. The process involves requirement analysis, system design, coding, testing, and deployment.
   Application: Financial systems have well-defined requirements and low tolerance for errors or changes. The Waterfall methodology allows the bank to ensure that each stage is completed thoroughly before moving on to the next, reducing the risk of errors in the final system.
 
 b. Agile: It is the iterative and incremental approach focused on the flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
    Examples of real-life scenarios of agile model:
    i. Scenario: A startup is building a mobile app to provide a new service to customers. The app’s features and user interface are likely to evolve based on user feedback.
    Application: Agile is ideal here because it allows the development team to release early versions of the app, gather user feedback, and make continuous improvements. Features can be prioritized and developed in short iterations, allowing the app to evolve and improve rapidly.

    ii. Scenario: An online retailer is developing a new e-commerce website, where the user interface and features need to be tailored based on customer feedback and market trends.
    Application: Agile allows the development team to build the website in stages, starting with a basic version and then adding features based on user behavior and feedback. This approach ensures the website remains user-friendly and up-to-date with market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. Sofware Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b. Quality Assurance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a. Integrated Development Environments(IDEs): There are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code e.g IntelliJ IDEA, Virtual Studio etc.
b. Version Control Systems(VCS): There are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members
e.g Git, Subversion etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Challenge: Requirements can evolve due to shifts in business goals, user feedback, or new technologies. This can lead to scope creep, rework, and delays.
   Strategies:
   i. Use Agile practices such as iterative development, regular sprint reviews, and flexible backlogs to accommodate changes in requirements more easily.
   ii. Keep close communication with stakeholders to understand changes early and assess their impact on the project.
   iii. Work with product owners to prioritize features and changes based on their impact and value, focusing on delivering the most critical functionalities first.
b. Challenge: Accumulating technical debt—taking shortcuts or building quick fixes—can lead to more complex, less maintainable codebases over time.
   Strategies:
   i. Allocate time in the development cycle for refactoring code and addressing technical debt incrementally.
   ii. Follow coding standards, perform code reviews, and use automated testing to maintain code quality and reduce the likelihood of introducing technical debt.
   iii. Proper documentation helps future developers (including yourself) understand the codebase and reduces the risk of compounding technical debt.
c. Challenge: There is often pressure to deliver software quickly, which can conflict with the need to maintain high quality.
   Strategies:
   i. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines automate testing and deployment, enabling faster releases without compromising quality.
   ii. Invest in unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to catch issues early in the development process.
   iii. Work with project managers and stakeholders to set achievable deadlines that allow for thorough testing and quality assurance.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a. Unit Testing: It is about testing individual components or modules of software.
   Importance: 
   i. It improves code quality.
   ii. It facilitates refactoring.
   iii. It enhances collaboration.
   iv. It supports Continuous Integration and Deployment.

b. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
   Importance: 
   i. It improves module interoperability.
   ii. It supports system reliability.
   iii. It validates system requirements
   iv. It identifies system level issues early.

c. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   Importance:
   i. Acceptance testing confirms that the software does what it’s supposed to according to the business requirements and user needs.
   ii. It checks that the software is user-friendly and meets the practical needs of those who will be using it, increasing the likelihood of user satisfaction.
   iii. By catching any issues or unmet requirements before release, acceptance testing helps avoid costly fixes and customer dissatisfaction after launch.
   iv. Successful acceptance testing indicates that the software is ready to go live, giving stakeholders confidence that it’s fit for purpose.

d. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
   Importance:
   i. It checks the software's functionality from end to end, making sure all parts work together as expected.
   ii. By testing the entire system, it helps identify and fix bugs before the software is released to users.
   iii. System testing verifies that the software meets all the specified requirements and behaves as intended.
   iv. It helps ensure that the software is user-friendly and performs well under real-world conditions.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting precise and effective input prompts to guide AI models in generating the desired output. It involves selecting the right words, structure, and context to optimize the AI's response.

Importance:
a. Improves Accuracy: Well-designed prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses from the AI.
b. Enhances Clarity: Clear prompts reduce ambiguity, helping the AI understand the user's intent better.
c. Controls Output: By fine-tuning prompts, users can influence the style, tone, and detail of the AI's responses.
d. Increases Efficiency: Effective prompts save time by reducing the need for multiple queries to get the right answer.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about something."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the benefits of daily exercise for mental health in three sentences."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more effective because it is:

a. Clear: It specifies exactly what information is being requested—benefits of daily exercise for mental health.
b. Specific: It narrows down the topic to a particular aspect of exercise (mental health benefits).
c. Concise: It sets a clear expectation for the length of the response (three sentences).
